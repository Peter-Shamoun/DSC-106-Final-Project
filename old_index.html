      <h3>What have we done so far?</h3>
      <p>So far, we have focused on laying the groundwork for our final web page by creating the foundational structure.
        We have developed our initial interactive visualization of a scatter plot with filtering as a primary component
        of our overall explorable explanation. We used D3.js, HTML, and CSS to create a scatter plot displaying trends
        in body temperatures in mice by gender, including the ability to filter the data display for a specified group.
        We have also introduced some key sections to be implemented into the final article layout, such as an
        introduction, observations, and key findings.</p>

      <h3>What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</h3>
      <p>The most challenging design of our project is creating the 'slideshow' of the visualization to effectively
        provide a story alongside the main visualization. This would be the most challenging as we would need to conduct
        our own EDA in order to discover insights to showcase, while also creating additional visualizations for each
        aspect of the story. This part of the design is not just challenging on a technical level, but it also requires
        some level of creativity. Creativity is essential if we are to provide a compelling and concise story that flows
        together for the users.</p>
